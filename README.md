# CI/CD testing repo

In this repository there are a few files in which I tried to implement CI/CD and test-driven-development techniques.

I mainly experimented with:

 - pytest
 - github actions
 - azure-functions

These technologies were mainly tried with an adapted version of my other project [INCItoc](https://github.com/DrMaruki97/INCItox)
